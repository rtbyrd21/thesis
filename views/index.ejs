<!-- <p>Principle Investigator: Rob Byrd</p>

<p>My name is Rob Byrd and I am a graduate student in the School of Design at the University of Cincinnati. I am conducting a research study on how imagery on websites may affect the amount of money given to charitable organizations.</p>

<p>This research study is open to anyone who is an adult 18 years and older.</p>

<p>If you agree to participate, you will only need to spend a brief amount of time, 5 minutes or less, to complete the task given to you.</p>

<p>Today, you will be asked to visit a website with hypothetical content and perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imagine you saw this site being shared on social media and were inclined to click through to the site.</li>
<li>Please keep in mind the website is hypothetical and no actual money is being exchanged on the site. With this in mind, please try to mimic the actions you would if this were an actual site that accepted actual donations. Explore the site and its content. </li>
<li>When you believe that you have a good understanding of the site’s content. Click on one of the “Donate” buttons. You will see a range of options, please select the option that would echo your actions if this were an actual site that you were inclined to visit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eligible participants will receive no direct benefit from participation. You will, however, be helping to design more effective non-verbal communication.</p>

<p>If you would like further information about this research study, you can email me at <a href="mailto:byrdrb@uc.edu">byrdrb@uc.edu</a> or call the School of Design at 556-4298.</p> -->

<p>H2O Nigeria is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization unlocking human potential by providing sustainable water projects to communities in sub-Saharan Africa who suffer needlessly from a lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation.</p>
<p>For over seven years, we have been helping communities gain access to clean, safe water by providing training, expertise and financial support for water project construction through our staff and implementing partners.</p>
<p>Our efforts at home amplify the voices of the poor and the nearly one billion people worldwide who don't have access to clean, safe water - a basic human right.</p>

  <div class="title-teaser">Providing water to people who can change everything.</div>
<p>Access to safe water is foundational to the development of any community. Clean water restores hope and unlocks potential.</p>
<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, we help communities dig wells, construct small sub-surface dams, catch the rain, protect fresh-water springs, filter surface water, and maintain proper sanitation and hygiene practices.</p>
<p>Your support enables robust community mobilization, careful project construction and rigorous long-term follow up and evaluation.

</p>
<p>As we work to provide water, we're committed to helping people meet their global neighbors and to realize that we all share the same basic needs. We hope to break down stereotypes and the false distinctions between the so-called winners and losers, rich and poor,
the needy and charitable, by introducing you to the people we serve with the respect and admiration they rightfully deserve.</p>

  <div class="title-teaser">People, not water, change everything.</div>
<p>We equip, train and fund local NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and missionaries with an established in-country presence who can help provide access to clean water and ensure its maintenance over time.</p>
<p>Smaller, more nimble, and locally-based implementation partners are incredibly effective and efficient at providing sustainable clean water solutions.</p>
<p>Together with our staff, they identify, implement, report on and follow up with every project. We then share learnings across all our programs. <br></p>
